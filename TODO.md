Figure out how to show multiple place model results on 1 places_map_container (eg amenities and campgrounds)

- Cell signals
x Get reviews working / updating place score
x View review images full-size
x Add filters
- force at least 1 star
- Map doesn't show after locking and unlocking phone?
  - probably webgl losing context https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/2656
  - can plugin to inspect after it happens?
- Don't load nearby map until tab is active
x Add review redirect back to reviews
- Reviews add to photos
- Show photos on place page


Feedback:
- Maybe 'nearby' is hard to get to? Seems like some people never see it



- Update Google Play & iOS descriptions
- Onboarding in chat. The community for Boondockers
- "Find me a WALMART!", maybe some people-of-walmart personality here while it's loading
- Nearest dump, fresh water
- Find campgrounds YouTubers have been to, link videos, Instagram posts?
  - Ask YouTuber if it's alright if we link to video from the page, explain FreeRoam

Things people want
- Ways to make money on road
- Better trip / gas station tools (ones out there are pretty decent though)
- To promote their instagram, website, etc...

Maybe a social profile that brings in YouTube videos, Instagram, map of where they've been, products they use
  - Don't think Instagram's API even lets us grab pics

- Need a better onboarding experience, introducing to vision

Boondocking
- Nearby dumpsites, freshwater, ...

Other feedback
- partners page, link to people's social media, etc...
  - application process, minimum number of followers
  - sort by most followers

- route planner that takes into account RV height
- truck / trailer finder by weight, truck towing capacities
- finding RV-friendly gas stations for gas
