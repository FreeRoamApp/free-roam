  - Get carrier, band, strength, maybe download speed?

- "Other" category for overnights
- Non-profit? Definitely requires more filing/time w/ form 990. That seems to be biggest drawback
- Better coloring for overlapping like Verizon + BLM (hard to make out which parts overlap)
- I think it's asking for PWA update after cache gets cleared when exoid doesn't match up (eg when group updates)
- Campground description
- Ask for rig information on first review (review extras)
- link to MVUM for USFS https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd575890.pdf
- make road condition seasonal
- usfs roads?
- offline
  - only cache map searches when recording enabled
    - cache w/o the bounds, so all show? or cache by zoom level?
  - better shells
- improve the shell/loading pages to have less thrashing / be more than just a spinner
- And maybe somewhere that would help us find out where/when gatherings are because I get a lot of questions about them! But I usually only know the west coast ones. So it would be nice to have one app that shared all the known gatherings and info.

Feedback:
- Maybe 'nearby' is hard to get to? Seems like some people never see it
- Map of places you've been. Roads you traveled would be cool too, if possible


x Update Google Play & iOS descriptions
- Onboarding in chat. The community for Boondockers
x "Find me a WALMART!", maybe some people-of-walmart personality here while it's loading
x Nearest dump, fresh water
- Find campgrounds YouTubers have been to, link videos, Instagram posts?
  - Ask YouTuber if it's alright if we link to video from the page, explain FreeRoam

Maybe a social profile that brings in YouTube videos, Instagram, map of where they've been, products they use

- Need a better onboarding experience, introducing to vision
