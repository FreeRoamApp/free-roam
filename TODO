  - https://github.com/Esri/cordova-plugin-advanced-geolocation
  - Get carrier, band, strength, maybe download speed?

- offline
  - only cache map searches when recording enabled
    - cache w/o the bounds, so all show? or cache by zoom level?
  - better shells
  x doesn't seem to cache screen resolution properly? drawer shows when it shouldn't for split second
  x record start/stop
  x record save pbf files?
  x show message when offline
  x dynamically update sw file with hashes
  x create shell paths
    - place/shell
    - /shell
  x rm staging from env vars in padlock
  x fix cache deletion portal call
  later only validate exoid if loaded from service worker cache?
  n? when logging in / out, clear deploy cache?
  x figure out server-side rendering. do server still get req?
      - want fast initial load, but also server to do initial data fetching i think
      - or we need js to be smart enough to not use exoid cache if loaded from cache
      - actually, have it use the server-side exoid cache, but request anyway and replace if different
  x store a shell for various page types. campground, places, chat, ... and load from that
    - try to minimize trashing?
    - include necessities (group, user.getMe, etc...)
    - problems/cons
      - an extra request on first time loading that type of page
      - more cpu being used by making that req and storing in the background
  n could store *all* exoid in indexdb/localstorage/cookie w/cache expiry?
    - always refetch new and replace if diff
    - could be slow doing all the isEqual diffs?
    - probably not a good idea, for now at least. go with recording method
  x bottom bar starts at 0 opacity, i guess because group var is empty

  x first run test on place page. shell vs no shell (server-side rendered)
    - run at 3g speed or worse?
    - server-side render
      - first content: 1300ms, fully loaded w/ images: 2500ms (i think because of time to parse js)
      - slow 3g: first content: 2800ms, fully loaded: 4000ms
    - service-worker
      - first content: first content: 2200ms, fully loaded: 2200ms
      - slow 3g: first content: 2200ms, fully loaded: 2200ms


- improve the shell/loading pages to have less thrashing / be more than just a spinner
- And maybe somewhere that would help us find out where/when gatherings are because I get a lot of questions about them! But I usually only know the west coast ones. So it would be nice to have one app that shared all the known gatherings and info.
  - divineontheroad
- rec.gov campgrounds
  - "Unvetted Campgrounds"
  x COE, WMA (wma too difficult to automate)
  - "We think this campsite is free, but you should verify through their website or phone number. If you've been here, please add a review so we can move this to our normal campground section!"
  - Adding review moves to normal campsite. Add review button on main tab too?
  x Show contact info
  - When creating new campground, once coordinates are put in, ask if it's one of the unvetted ones
- Favorite GPS points (not just campgrounds)
  - Be able to send that GPS point as a clickable Google Map link to other apps (text, Slack, email, Google Auto)
  - roadpickle
- Exoid cache gets very large with all of the place.search reqs. Clear them out

- Don't load nearby map until tab is active
x Add review redirect back to reviews

Feedback:
- Maybe 'nearby' is hard to get to? Seems like some people never see it
- Map of places you've been. Roads you traveled would be cool too, if possible


x Update Google Play & iOS descriptions
- Onboarding in chat. The community for Boondockers
x "Find me a WALMART!", maybe some people-of-walmart personality here while it's loading
x Nearest dump, fresh water
- Find campgrounds YouTubers have been to, link videos, Instagram posts?
  - Ask YouTuber if it's alright if we link to video from the page, explain FreeRoam

Maybe a social profile that brings in YouTube videos, Instagram, map of where they've been, products they use
  - Don't think Instagram's API even lets us grab pics

- Need a better onboarding experience, introducing to vision
