- Reputation & Leveling, plan it out
  - Start with 10 levels
    -
  - Earn for:
    - Posting a review (initially, eventually get rid of in favor of likes)
    - Review getting likes
    - Photo getting likes
    - Forum thread getting likes



  - WoW, Clash Royale, Fam
  - Use XP code as base
  - Notifications when you gain rep
  - Named levels (themed after forest system?)

  - **Is it site-wide or group-wide???**
    - If it's site-wide should thread votes count? I guess so, similar to Reddit

  - Review voting
  - Photo voting
- See who other sites have partnered with for gear giveaways and reach out to company
  - See what they got out of it, what they wish they got out of it
- Run contests for people w/ most rep each week

TODOS:
- Review voting
- Photo voting


- Saved places
  - Should be mappable, so extend place_base
  - Should it have it's own page, or just a checkbox on the map search???
    - Have it on it's own page. My Map: Past & Future modes?
    - How will this work with places you've been. Separate, or merged?
  - Should enough data be stored for it, or should it query db for each place?

- Delete campground
  - https://freeroam.app/campground/the-salty-spot-iqualuit/reviews
- Cost and discounts would be useful. For example, New Mexico state parks are crazy-cheap with an annual pass, which is why so many full-timers come here. Some BLM campgrounds offer 1/2 price camping for someone with a National Parks pass. Etc.
  - The Good Luck Duck
- Allow people to contribute cell information:
  - https://github.com/Esri/cordova-plugin-advanced-geolocation
  - Get carrier, band, strength, maybe download speed?
- Allow searching campground name
- Allow searching type? Eg "Walmarts" gets them to the right place
- Legend? Icon -> Name
- "Location you're searching not showing? Let us know! **button**"
- Places nearby: show closets & show all toggle (so it's not a bunch of walmarts)
- Merge reviewless_campgrounds into campgrounds.
  x Keep the orange icon for ones w/ reviews
  x Gray icon for reviewless
  x Add `source` column to campgrounds
  - Make it clear first time filtering that it'll only keep the orange ones
  - Warning message on campgrounds w/o review
  x Delete reviewless campgrounds
- Show icons when choosing "Show me...".
- Exoid cache gets very large with all of the place.search reqs. Clear them out
- Message first time clicking on a filter saying it's only for that data type
x Select a more appropriate zoom level for geocoding
x "Other" category for overnights
- Non-profit? Definitely requires more filing/time w/ form 990. That seems to be biggest drawback
- Better coloring for overlapping like Verizon + BLM (hard to make out which parts overlap)
n Inline css req for shell, then load in the rest async
- Seems to difficult and if we were to do it, we'd have to generate css for every page, or just the home page
- I think it's asking for PWA update after cache gets cleared when exoid doesn't match up (eg when group updates)
- Campground description
- Ask for rig information on first review (review extras)
- link to MVUM for USFS https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd575890.pdf
- make road condition seasonal
- usfs roads?
- offline
  - only cache map searches when recording enabled
    - cache w/o the bounds, so all show? or cache by zoom level?
  - better shells
- improve the shell/loading pages to have less thrashing / be more than just a spinner
- And maybe somewhere that would help us find out where/when gatherings are because I get a lot of questions about them! But I usually only know the west coast ones. So it would be nice to have one app that shared all the known gatherings and info.

  x COE, WMA (wma too difficult to automate)

  - When creating new campground, once coordinates are put in, ask if it's one of the unvetted ones

- Map of places you've been. Roads you traveled would be cool too, if possible

x "Find me a WALMART!", maybe some people-of-walmart personality here while it's loading
