- DONE Use modularized RxJS
- DONE, sort of (loading separate file) Figure out a solution to load CSS dynamically and see if it's faster?
- DONE Make own build of iscroll like iscroll-lite, but with snap
- Test using .publishReplay(1).refCount() in places where a mapped observable is subscribed to multiple times
- Unrelated to speed, need to swap localStorage with something else in native iOS app (gets cleared too often)
- Set user and groupUser in avatar header instead of as props

- optimize FormattedMessage. markdown parser is slow (1-5ms per message)
