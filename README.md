# free-roam

## Manifesto
The goal with [FreeRoam](https://freeroam.app) is to build an open community and resource app for free roamers.

Sticking with openness, FreeRoam is open source. [free-roam](https://github.com/freeroamapp/free-roam) contains the client-side code, [back-roads](https://github.com/freeroamapp/back-roads) has the backend code, and  [free-roam-assets](https://github.com/freeroamapp/free-roam-assets).

### Backstory
We're a couple who are just starting out on their full-time RVing lifestyle. Austin's parents have done it for several years now, and we decided to follow suit.

### The team
Rachel: design and community
Austin: programming

### License
This repository currently does not have a license until we figure out the best open-source license down the road, but our primary goal right now is transparency. You can read more about what "No License" means [here](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/).
