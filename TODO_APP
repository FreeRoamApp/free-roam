- Reputation & Leveling, plan it out
  - Start with 10 levels
    -
  - Earn for:
    - Posting a review (initially, eventually get rid of in favor of likes)
    - Review getting likes
    - Photo getting likes
    - Forum thread getting likes



  - WoW, Clash Royale, Fam
  - Use XP code as base
  - Notifications when you gain rep
  - Named levels (themed after forest system?)

  - **Is it site-wide or group-wide???**
    - If it's site-wide should thread votes count? I guess so, similar to Reddit

  - Review voting
  - Photo voting
- See who other sites have partnered with for gear giveaways and reach out to company
  - See what they got out of it, what they wish they got out of it
- Run contests for people w/ most rep each week

TODOS:
- Review voting
- Photo voting

x First-time pack-in, pack-out educational tips
x Add cleanliness so people can find dirty places to help clean up

- Let people add their website link / instagram

- Saved places
  x Empty state

  - Should be mappable, so extend place_base
  - Should it have it's own page, or just a checkbox on the map search???
    - Have it on it's own page. My Map: Past & Future modes?
    - How will this work with places you've been. Separate, or merged?
  - Should enough data be stored for it, or should it query db for each place?
    - Query per place w/ cache (since place info changes)
  x Needs to store
    - sourceType: campground, amenity, coordinate, etc...
    - sourceId (if coordinate, use stringified coordinate?)
    - time saved
    - time visited? (later)

    x doesn't really work if extending off of placeBase since we don't store location and other details (in case name / rating changes)
      - how does search query work? seems inefficient to grab all ids, then embed all info...
      - probably best to just treat them differently and always just grab all places by userId
        - don't need elasticsearch in this case.
      - people might want to filter down list by where they zoom on map, so would have to be able to do that with cached list

  x /my-places
    - List for now, map later


- Performance
  x current 269kb gzipped
  x remark-parse is pretty large
    x includes parse-entities and character-entities
      x try removing these? don't seem super necessary
    x 164kb / 2.38mb (6.9% of bundle)
  - could remove socket.io to save 15kb (~6%) gzipped
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38546496/moving-from-socket-io-to-raw-websockets/38546537#38546537
  x firebase is pretty large
    x 198kb (8.3% of bundle)
  - lodash
    - 294kb (12.4% of bundle)
    - pre-minify and gzip though
  - Code splitting for performance
    - https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-javascript/code-splitting/
    - https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports dynamic imports...
      - that should generate all the proper chunks
    - https://webpack.js.org/guides/lazy-loading/
      - load in the proper chunks when ready
    - should analyze which components are biggest and can be chunked.
      - eg may all group admin stuff is chunked and lazy loaded when navigating to one of those pages...
      - in some cases, should idly prefetch chunks (webpackPrefetch)
      - can this be done at router level like example here: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-javascript/code-splitting/ (under "Prefetching")
    - need to use import instead of require
    - look into how discord chunks up their js
      - https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-maintains-performance-while-adding-features-28ddaf044333
  - check if having opacities on layers/icons slows things down
    - run chrome performance check. one slow fn is updateLayerOpacities

- Ask for RV size when reviewing (stored rig info) and filter by rv size
- Delete campground
  - https://freeroam.app/campground/the-salty-spot-iqualuit/reviews
- Cost and discounts would be useful. For example, New Mexico state parks are crazy-cheap with an annual pass, which is why so many full-timers come here. Some BLM campgrounds offer 1/2 price camping for someone with a National Parks pass. Etc.
  - The Good Luck Duck
- Allow people to contribute cell information:
  - https://github.com/Esri/cordova-plugin-advanced-geolocation
  - Get carrier, band, strength, maybe download speed?
- Allow searching campground name
- Allow searching type? Eg "Walmarts" gets them to the right place
- Legend? Icon -> Name
- "Location you're searching not showing? Let us know! **button**"
- Places nearby: show closets & show all toggle (so it's not a bunch of walmarts)
- Merge reviewless_campgrounds into campgrounds.
  x Keep the orange icon for ones w/ reviews
  x Gray icon for reviewless
  x Add `source` column to campgrounds
  - Make it clear first time filtering that it'll only keep the orange ones
  - Warning message on campgrounds w/o review
  x Delete reviewless campgrounds
n Show icons when choosing "Show me...".
- Exoid cache gets very large with all of the place.search reqs. Clear them out
- Message first time clicking on a filter saying it's only for that data type
x Welcome PM with red dot
  x Welcome to FreeRoam! I'm Austin, the guy who is programming the app. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for how Rachel and I can improve it!
  x Probably best to not create an actual message or conversation until user clicks to conversation
    x Once they click, create both message and conversation
x Select a more appropriate zoom level for geocoding
x "Other" category for overnights
x Better coloring for overlapping like Verizon + BLM (hard to make out which parts overlap)
n Inline css req for shell, then load in the rest async
  n Seems to difficult and if we were to do it, we'd have to generate css for every page, or just the home page
x I think it's asking for PWA update after cache gets cleared when exoid doesn't match up (eg when group updates)
- Campground description
- Ask for rig information on first review (review extras)
- link to MVUM for USFS https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd575890.pdf
- make road condition seasonal
- usfs roads?
- offline
  - only cache map searches when recording enabled
    - cache w/o the bounds, so all show? or cache by zoom level?
  - better shells
- improve the shell/loading pages to have less thrashing / be more than just a spinner
- And maybe somewhere that would help us find out where/when gatherings are because I get a lot of questions about them! But I usually only know the west coast ones. So it would be nice to have one app that shared all the known gatherings and info.
  - divineontheroad
- rec.gov campgrounds
  x "Unvetted Campgrounds"
  x COE, WMA (wma too difficult to automate)
  - "We think this campsite is free, but you should verify through their website or phone number. If you've been here, please add a review so we can move this to our normal campground section!"
  - Adding review moves to normal campsite. Add review button on main tab too?
  x Show contact info
  - When creating new campground, once coordinates are put in, ask if it's one of the unvetted ones
- Favorite GPS points (not just campgrounds)
  - Be able to send that GPS point as a clickable Google Map link to other apps (text, Slack, email, Google Auto)
  - roadpickle
- ATV trails as a nearby amenity
  - Filter by distance to ATV trails
  - https://bit.ly/2JnjQBD
- Edit review use initial season for value?
x Tooltip picture and reviews
x Swipe / tap through gallery of images
- "We don't have any data for this season yet, but here\'s what it was like in *season*"
- no reviews -> loading
- pad types, mark seasonal campgrounds (checkbox when creating + dates its open / link)
- compress images before upload
x Mark low overhangs, sharp turns
- Add gyms
x overlay$ -> model. get all overlay, sheet, dialog components
x method to input sliders for other seasons w/o adding review score
x 4g/3g toggle for signal
x coordinates from images

x Cell signals
x Get reviews working / updating place score
x View review images full-size
x Add filters
x force at least 1 star
n Map doesn't show after locking and unlocking phone?
  n probably webgl losing context https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/2656
  n can plugin to inspect after it happens?
  n couldn't replicate anymore
- Don't load nearby map until tab is active
x Add review redirect back to reviews
x Reviews add to photos
x Show photos on place page


Feedback:
- Maybe 'nearby' is hard to get to? Seems like some people never see it
- Map of places you've been. Roads you traveled would be cool too, if possible


x Update Google Play & iOS descriptions
- Onboarding in chat. The community for Boondockers
x "Find me a WALMART!", maybe some people-of-walmart personality here while it's loading
x Nearest dump, fresh water
- Find campgrounds YouTubers have been to, link videos, Instagram posts?
  - Ask YouTuber if it's alright if we link to video from the page, explain FreeRoam

Things people want
- Ways to make money on road
- Better trip / gas station tools (ones out there are pretty decent though)
- To promote their instagram, website, etc...

Maybe a social profile that brings in YouTube videos, Instagram, map of where they've been, products they use
  - Don't think Instagram's API even lets us grab pics

- Need a better onboarding experience, introducing to vision

Boondocking
x Nearby dumpsites, freshwater, ...

Other feedback
- partners page, link to people's social media, etc...
  - application process, minimum number of followers
  - sort by most followers

- route planner that takes into account RV height
- truck / trailer finder by weight, truck towing capacities
- finding RV-friendly gas stations for gas
- Hey Techy Rvers, anyone know how to make a cool map of the places youâ€™ve been and traveled to this year. Maybe with each trip being a different color, able to put favorite pictures next to them or when clicked on?
