    x Have it on it's own page. My Map: Past & Future modes?
    x How will this work with places you've been. Separate, or merged?
  x Should enough data be stored for it, or should it query db for each place?
    x Query per place w/ cache (since place info changes)
  x Needs to store
    x sourceType: campground, amenity, coordinate, etc...
    x sourceId (if coordinate, use stringified coordinate?)
    x time saved
    x time visited? (later)

    x doesn't really work if extending off of placeBase since we don't store location and other details (in case name / rating changes)
      x how does search query work? seems inefficient to grab all ids, then embed all info...
      x probably best to just treat them differently and always just grab all places by userId
        x don't need elasticsearch in this case.
      x people might want to filter down list by where they zoom on map, so would have to be able to do that with cached list

  x /my-places
    x List for now, map later


- Performance
  - separate out strings into another file that's a json string that gets parsed?
    - https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019
  - exoid invalidate partials
  x Zorium v2? Tried it out, render seems a little slower (20-50%) vs current
    x replacing just z.state with v2 also seems 50-100% slower
  x current 269kb gzipped
  x remark-parse is pretty large
    x includes parse-entities and character-entities
      x try removing these? don't seem super necessary
    x 164kb / 2.38mb (6.9% of bundle)
  - could remove socket.io to save 15kb (~6%) gzipped
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38546496/moving-from-socket-io-to-raw-websockets/38546537#38546537
  x firebase is pretty large
    x 198kb (8.3% of bundle)
  - lodash
    - 294kb (12.4% of bundle)
    - pre-minify and gzip though
  - Code splitting for performance
    - Already doing for firebase, so extend off of that
    - Can probably chunk out the mod tools and/or logged-in pages
    - profile_dialog, icon, filter_dialog, only 2.5% of code though, most of code is long tail of components
    - https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-javascript/code-splitting/
    - https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports dynamic imports...
      - that should generate all the proper chunks
    - https://webpack.js.org/guides/lazy-loading/
      - load in the proper chunks when ready
    - should analyze which components are biggest and can be chunked.
      - eg may all group admin stuff is chunked and lazy loaded when navigating to one of those pages...
      - in some cases, should idly prefetch chunks (webpackPrefetch)
      - can this be done at router level like example here: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-javascript/code-splitting/ (under "Prefetching")
    - need to use import instead of require
    - look into how discord chunks up their js
      - https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-maintains-performance-while-adding-features-28ddaf044333
  - check if having opacities on layers/icons slows things down
    - run chrome performance check. one slow fn is updateLayerOpacities

    - Exoid cache gets very large with all of the place.search reqs. Clear them out
    - Message first time clicking on a filter saying it's only for that data type?
x Ask for RV size when reviewing (stored rig info) and filter by rv size
- Delete campground
  - https://freeroam.app/campground/the-salty-spot-iqualuit/reviews
- Cost and discounts would be useful. For example, New Mexico state parks are crazy-cheap with an annual pass, which is why so many full-timers come here. Some BLM campgrounds offer 1/2 price camping for someone with a National Parks pass. Etc.
  - The Good Luck Duck
- Allow people to contribute cell information:
  - https://github.com/Esri/cordova-plugin-advanced-geolocation
  - Get carrier, band, strength, maybe download speed?
- Search
  x Allow searching campground name
  - Allow searching type? Eg "Walmarts" gets them to the right place
  - Common queries:
    - Florida, Dump / Dump Station, Tucson, Arizona, Moab, Bakersfield, Las Cruces, Ohio
    - Only ~10-15 queries over a month for dump station, so probably not worth to add yet?
- "Location you're searching not showing? Let us know! **button**"
- Warning message on campgrounds w/o reviews
- Campground description
x Ask for rig information on first review (review extras)
- link to MVUM for USFS https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd575890.pdf
- make road condition seasonal
n usfs roads?
- offline
  - only cache map searches when recording enabled
    - cache w/o the bounds, so all show? or cache by zoom level?
  x better shells
- improve the shell/loading pages to have less thrashing / be more than just a spinner
  x homepage
  - place page
- And maybe somewhere that would help us find out where/when gatherings are because I get a lot of questions about them! But I usually only know the west coast ones. So it would be nice to have one app that shared all the known gatherings and info.

  x went with fading out non-closest
x Merge reviewless_campgrounds into campgrounds.

  x Gray icon for reviewless
  x Add `source` column to campgrounds
  n Make it clear first time filtering that it'll only keep the orange ones

n Show icons when choosing "Show me...".
x Welcome PM with red dot
  x Welcome to FreeRoam! I'm Austin, the guy who is programming the app. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for how Rachel and I can improve it!
  x Probably best to not create an actual message or conversation until user clicks to conversation
    x Once they click, create both message and conversation
x Select a more appropriate zoom level for geocoding
x "Other" category for overnights
x Better coloring for overlapping like Verizon + BLM (hard to make out which parts overlap)
n Inline css req for shell, then load in the rest async
  n Seems to difficult and if we were to do it, we'd have to generate css for every page, or just the home page
x I think it's asking for PWA update after cache gets cleared when exoid doesn't match up (eg when group updates)
x rec.gov campgrounds
  x "Unvetted Campgrounds"
  x COE, WMA (wma too difficult to automate)
  n "We think this campsite is free, but you should verify through their website or phone number. If you've been here, please add a review so we can move this to our normal campground section!"
  n Adding review moves to normal campsite. Add review button on main tab too?
  x Show contact info
  n When creating new campground, once coordinates are put in, ask if it's one of the unvetted ones

n Map doesn't show after locking and unlocking phone?
  n probably webgl losing context https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/2656
  n can plugin to inspect after it happens?
  n couldn't replicate anymore
x Add review redirect back to reviews
x Reviews add to photos
x Show photos on place page

- Make BLM and USFS map overlays single color (rm duplicates?)
- Places traveled
  x integrate with my places
  x Page with all places, can drag to rearrange order
    x Edit button for each places which brings to 'add/edit place page'
    no "Add another" button at bottom that opens add place page
  x Add place page
    x Location, pictures
    - Option to add it as a campground (then go through the normal steps and request review)
    - If they add as campground, use that for my places type, otherwise use coordinate
      - Need to add price as an option, maybe other stuff (pad type)
  x DB table: trips
    x name, userId, places: [{sourceId, sourceType, startTime, endTime, attachments}]
  - Option to generate from photo library?
  x Ability to share to FB, Instagram
  - In map view, people can click on a campground to go to that campground page
  - Allow invisible points to have map choose correct route?
  - Do a specific color per month on map?
    - Or let them choose color per leg of trip?
  - Stats w/ map: miles traveled, states visited


- Cluster points on backend? send client coordinates only of clustered points then cluster client?
  - Problem with clustering is we're showing data points from multiple sources (eg campgrounds & overnights)
    so clustering would overlap. Would need to fetch all points in 1 req
  - Better solution is probbly just a more even distribution

  - Maybe cluster only when map is zoomed out AND there are more than 250 results?
    - That would require 2 ES queries though and not be great for offline mode?



Feedback:
- Maybe 'nearby' is hard to get to? Seems like some people never see it
- Map of places you've been. Roads you traveled would be cool too, if possible


x Update Google Play & iOS descriptions
x Onboarding in chat. The community for Boondockers
x "Find me a WALMART!", maybe some people-of-walmart personality here while it's loading
x Nearest dump, fresh water
n Find campgrounds YouTubers have been to, link videos, Instagram posts?
  n Ask YouTuber if it's alright if we link to video from the page, explain FreeRoam

Things people want
- Ways to make money on road
- Better trip / gas station tools (ones out there are pretty decent though)
- To promote their instagram, website, etc...

Maybe a social profile that brings in YouTube videos, Instagram, map of where they've been, products they use
  - Don't think Instagram's API even lets us grab pics

- Need a better onboarding experience, introducing to vision

Boondocking
x Nearby dumpsites, freshwater, ...

Other feedback
- route planner that takes into account RV height
- truck / trailer finder by weight, truck towing capacities
- finding RV-friendly gas stations for gas
- Hey Techy Rvers, anyone know how to make a cool map of the places you’ve been and traveled to this year. Maybe with each trip being a different color, able to put favorite pictures next to them or when clicked on?
