This file will eventually have a guide on how to setup FreeRoam to run locally for you.

Right now FreeRoam doesn't have a license, so it's probably best to wait until we have that setup to contribute any code.

The first priority with getting the code on GitHub was to be transparent. The next priority is getting this setup so others can contribute, but that's further down the todo list.

If you have any questions, please email me: austin@freeroam.app
