# ROADMAP
- Focus on becoming main place for finding campgrounds
  - Make life easier for people wanting to live closer to nature
  - Educate *everyone*
    - Need to figure out how to incentivize current trash-producers to stop, and get others to help pick up
- Generate revenue
  - Ideally want to make big impacts w/ revenues, not just donations
  - Be able to cover operational costs before accepting donations, so all donations go toward cleaning up, etc... (like Charity: Water)
- In-the-field projects
  - Cleaning up
  - Work with government to open new areas, improve road conditions?

- Non-profit? Definitely requires more filing/time w/ form 990. That seems to be biggest drawback
  - Typically non-profits run off of donations
  - Ad revenue is considered UBI (unrelated business income) and is taxed
  - Some non-profits have sponsors which aren't taxed?
  - Talk to Ali and Hadi Partovi (code.org) for advice
  - Can form a non-profit and have 27 months to file for 501c3 exemption status be applied retroactively (not sure this matters)
    - If the organization files Form 1023 after the deadline has passed, generally, recognition of 501(c)(3) status will be given only from the date the Form was filed.
    - So should just pay taxes and be fine, but we'll probably apply for 501c3 before 27 months?
    - I think we fall under "Environmental and animals (e.g., wildlife organizations)"
  - Need to file 1023ez
    - Apparently need to have 3 board members, or 5? if Rachel and I on board (no other relatives)
      - Me, Cristian, Kelsey?
  - https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/about/public-records/ is useful
  - foundation classification is probably "A"
  - https://www.rcfp.org/nonprofit-news-guide/taxation-unrelated-business-taxable-income/losing-tax-exempt-status-because-too
    - We'll probably have a high UBIT, so we'll probably need to do what Mozilla did and have a corporation that the foundation is the only shareholder of
    - Though maybe the income is mission-related since it's education? https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-much-unrelated-earned-income-can-a-nonprofit-receive-2501873
  - Make less than $50k this year and apply to YC the next year to get help with structure?
    - Can file 990-N which is super easy
  - Get advice from:
    - tbiz
    - code.org founders? Watsi? ...?

# LONGTERM
- This is a good article: https://givebutter.com/blog/millennials-dont-care-about-your-nonprofit
- Have revenue or corporate donors cover overhead, so individuals' money can go more directly toward mission
  - Eg. https://www.charitywater.org
- My experience with nonprofits is some of the campaigns can get excessive/annoying (constant mail, etc...)
  - Focus on having enough to make an impact from revenue, and visibility to donate can just be from being an app people use consistently

- Maybe give BLM hosts a way to track how long vehicles have been there?
- Give Walmart managers tools?
