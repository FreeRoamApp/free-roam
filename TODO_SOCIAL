Points reflect social good

Maybe levels are too much for this demographic. Could just do points / coins

Name: Karma

- Reputation & Leveling, plan it out
  - Earn for:
    - Posting a review (initially, eventually get rid of in favor of likes)
    - Sharing
    - Review getting likes
    - Photo getting likes
    - Forum thread getting likes?
      - Maybe have separation between likes and "helpful"/"thank you"
  - Later on
    - Cleaning up
    - Donating?
  - Should downvotes remove karma?
    - Yes, cap negative at -100
  - Is there anything that has a maxCount per time?
    - Maybe daily chat message? Daily chat message "thank you"
- Is there any advantage to storing all earn_transactions?
  - User can see log of where they got their karma from?
    - Would need to get rid of ttl / txn check
  - Will do it since earn_transactions will also be for coins if we do it, need to prevent abuse




- Actual steps
  x Have it per user instead of per group
  - Increase / decrease count
    - If karma is <= -100, don't decrease
  - If maxCount, don't insert transaction


### what are the real rewards? eg talent points in wow, new gear available, dungeons
### WHY does a user want to level up?



  - WoW, Clash Royale, Fam
  - Use XP code as base
  - Notifications when you gain rep
  - Named levels (themed after forest system?)

  - **Is it site-wide or group-wide???**
    - If it's site-wide should thread votes count? I guess so, similar to Reddit

  - Review voting
  - Photo voting
- See who other sites have partnered with for gear giveaways and reach out to company
  - See what they got out of it, what they wish they got out of it
- Run contests for people w/ most rep each week
- Notification when someone likes your review? A la Instagram?
- I think badges (achievements) are a must
- Leaderboard
- Turn this into an agent for good. Huge points for attending cleanup events

- Should you get points for checking in?
- Need to figure out if points should be given as reputation/karma (reviews, etc..) or activity (check-ins, etc..)

Activity route:
-No levels, just points
- Earn for:
  - First check-in bonus points
  - Check-in
  - Review
  - Photos

Karma route
- Earn for
  - People thumbing up reviews, posts, photos


Definitely want at least badges. Still undecided on activity based points (exp) vs solely reputation based (karma)
