- Reputation & Leveling, plan it out
  - Start with 10 levels?
    -
  - Earn for:
    - Posting a review (initially, eventually get rid of in favor of likes)
    - Review getting likes
    - Photo getting likes
    - Forum thread getting likes

### what are the real rewards? eg talent points in wow, new gear available, dungeons
### WHY does a user want to level up?



  - WoW, Clash Royale, Fam
  - Use XP code as base
  - Notifications when you gain rep
  - Named levels (themed after forest system?)

  - **Is it site-wide or group-wide???**
    - If it's site-wide should thread votes count? I guess so, similar to Reddit

  - Review voting
  - Photo voting
- See who other sites have partnered with for gear giveaways and reach out to company
  - See what they got out of it, what they wish they got out of it
- Run contests for people w/ most rep each week
- Notification when someone likes your review? A la Instagram?
- I think badges (achievements) are a must
- Leaderboard
- Turn this into an agent for good. Huge points for attending cleanup events

- Should you get points for checking in?
- Need to figure out if points should be given as reputation/karma (reviews, etc..) or activity (check-ins, etc..)

Activity route:
-No levels, just points
- Earn for:
  - First check-in bonus points
  - Check-in
  - Review
  - Photos

Karma route
- Earn for
  - People thumbing up reviews, posts, photos


Definitely want at least badges. Still undecided on activity based points (exp) vs solely reputation based (karma)
